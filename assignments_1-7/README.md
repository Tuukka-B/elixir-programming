* Every assignment has a mainloop, and that is how you execute them. The only exception is Assignment 6, which requires more user interaction. See [lib/ass6/ass6.ex](./lib/ass6/ass6.ex) for more details and examples considering it. 
* Every ass(x).ex file has documentation inside it you can look for examples to help you with.
