Server 						-> Does not depend on anything

Server Storage 				-> Does not depend on anything

Server Connection Agent 	-> Depends on Server Storage


Client						-> Depends on Client Storage
	
Client Storage				-> Does not depend on anything

Client connection Agent		-> Depends on Client Storage


Client supervisor:

	- could start Storage

Client.agent supervisor:

	- could restart Client Connection agent when neseccary
	- could restart Client when necessary


Server supervisor:

	- could start Storage
	- could start Server

Server.agent supervisor:

	- could restart Server Connection agent when neseccary


TO-DO:

	make Client and Server start undepend on Storage
		-- atomic name for storage

	if Server crashes, socket is lost
		-- maybe Storage should hold this too?

	if ConnectionAgent crashes, server crashes
		-- use start instead of start_link

	if Client Storage crashes, Client & Client Connection agent crash
		-- make Storage independent (use atomic name)

	if Client Connection Agent crashes, Client crashes 
		-- start Connection Agent with start instead of start_link
